# dropin-svelte
Svelte """Hooks"""

Examples of how to achieve drop-in functionality with Svelte. Something like React Hooks. Should be easy to use - just drop into any of your components.

Whether the same level of composability as React Hooks can be achieved easily is an open question (to me, at least). Examples may or may not endeavor to be composable. See https://github.com/ryanatkn/assorted-svelte-tidbits/blob/master/tidbits/composing-svelte-stores-vs-react-hooks.md

Avoid examples which involve proper nouns like Redux or Firebase, and/or which seem to solve React-specific problems (forms, etc).
